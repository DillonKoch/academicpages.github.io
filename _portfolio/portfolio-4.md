Each week the three analysts are given $1,000 each to bet on any sports game throughout the week. The analysts can bet as much or as little as they want per bet, but they all must make 4 bets per day, totaling 20 bets per week. Whoever has the most money at the end of the week wins.

I became interested in sports betting recently after it was federally legalized in May 2018, and especially now since it's legal in Iowa as of August 2019. What's not to love about it? It's a great mix of sports and data, it makes watching games more interesting, and if you do well you can make money! 

I also find it much more interesting than fantasy sports because sports betting looks at the games through mostly the same angle as the players and coaches. For example, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick would be glad to win a game 13-3, as would people who bet on the Patriots. On the other hadn, someone who had Tom Brady in fantasy football would probably be disappointed in the lack of yards and touchdowns from Brady.
