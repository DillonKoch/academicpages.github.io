Hi, my name is Dillon Koch and I am currently a Data Science Intern at Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. This fall I'll be a senior at the University of Iowa and I'll graduate in December 2019. I am currently looking for a full-time role as a data scientist post-graduation.

I made this website to show some of the data science projects I've worked on in more detail than I could on a resume or LinkedIn. If you go to the 'Projects' section of this site, you'll see some of the cool projects I've worked on and the Python code I used to create them (unfortunately I can't describe many projects in detail due to intellectual property and data privacy concerns).

I also included my resume in another section and my contact information in the sidebar. Feel free to contact me!
