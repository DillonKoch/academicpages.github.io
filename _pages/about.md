Hi, my name is Dillon Koch and I am currently a Data Science Intern at Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I'm also about to graduate from the University of Iowa in December 2019, and I'm currently looking for a full-time role as a data scientist post-graduation.

I made this website to show some of the data science projects I've worked on in more detail than I could on a resume or LinkedIn. If you go to the 'Projects' section of this site, you'll see some of the cool projects I've worked on and the Python code I used to create them. However, I can't describe some of my projects in detail on this site for intellectual property and data privacy reasons.

I also included my resume in another section and my contact information in the sidebar. Feel free to contact me!
