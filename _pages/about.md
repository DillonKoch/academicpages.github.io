Hi, my name is Dillon Koch and I'm a Data Science Intern at Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I'll also graduate from the University of Iowa in December 2019 with a degree in Business Analytics.

I made this website to show some of the data science projects I've worked on in more detail than I could on a resume or LinkedIn. If you go to the 'Projects' section of this site, you'll see some of the cool projects I've worked on and the Python code I used to create them. However, I'm not able to describe some of my projects in detail on this site for intellectual property and data privacy reasons.
